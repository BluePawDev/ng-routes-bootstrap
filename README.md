# Angular Routes + Bootstrap
## Overview
Using AngularJS routes to display information on three fictional characters.
The page will have a header, footer, and three buttons that swap the page content to display the different characters.

### Sample Characters
- Harry Potter (Harry Potter books/movies)
- Storm (X-Men)
- Frodo (Lord of the Rings)
- Samus Aran (Metroid)
- Indiana Jones (movies)
- Michonne (Walking Dead)

## Content
Feel free to use Google for the content or make up your own! Include some images and use Bootstrap for styling it!

## Hard Mode
Use `ng-show`, `ng-hide`, or `ng-if` to add dynamic elements to views when users click on things.
